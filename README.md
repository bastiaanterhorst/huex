# Huex

Elixir client for Philips Hue connected light bulbs.

## Installation

Add Huex as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [ { :huex, "~> 0.6" } ]
end
```

After you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile Huex.

## Usage

### First Connection

In order to issue queries and commands to the bridge, we need to request an authorization for a so-called `devicetype` (see [Hue Configuration API](http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/configuration-api)) which is a string formatted as such: `my-app#my-device`.

**Before requesting the authorization**: you must **press the link button** on your bridge device to start a 30 second window during which you may request an authorization as follow:

```elixir
bridge = Huex.connect("192.168.1.100") |> Huex.authorize("my-app#my-device")

# A random username is now set
IO.puts bridge.username
# YApVhLTwWUTlGJDo...

# The bridge connection is now ready for use
IO.inspect Huex.info(bridge)
# %{"config" => ...}

```

### Subsequent Connections

Once a `devicetype` has been authorized with the bridge, there's no need to perform the authorization process again. In other words, you must **store the generated username** received set by `authorize/2`. With the username at hand, you can connect right away:

```elixir
bridge = Huex.connect("192.168.1.100", "YApVhLTwWUTlGJDo...")

IO.inspect Huex.info(bridge)
# %{"config" => ...}

```

### Queries

Query functions return the message received from the bridge API.

```elixir
IO.inspect Huex.info(bridge)
# %{"config" => %{"UTC" => "1970-01-01T03:00:40", "dhcp" => true,
#   "gateway" => "192.168.1.1", "ipaddress" => "192.168.1.100",
#    ...
#   "schedules" => %{}}

IO.inspect Huex.lights(bridge)
# %{"1" => %{"name" => "Lobby"}, "2" => %{"name" => "Living Room"},
#    "3" => %{"name" => "Bedroom"}}

IO.inspect Huex.light_info(bridge, 1)
# %{"modelid" => "LCT001", "name" => "Lobby",
#   ...
#   "swversion" => "66009663", "type" => "Extended color light"}
```

### Commands

Command functions return a `Huex.Bridge` struct and are thus chainable.

```elixir
bridge
|> Huex.turn_off(1)                                  # Turn off light 1
|> Huex.turn_on(2)                                   # Turn on light 2
|> Huex.set_color(2, {10000, 255, 255})              # HSV
|> Huex.set_color(2, {0.167, 0.04})                  # XY
|> Huex.set_color(2, Huex.Color.rgb(1, 0.75, 0.25))  # RGB (see limitations)
|> Huex.set_brightness(2, 0.75)                      # Brightness at 75%
|> Huex.nudge_brightness(2, -0.1)                      # Reduce brightness with 10%
|> Huex.turn_group_on_with_scene(2, "Sexy time")      # Apply a scene to a group
```

#### Error Handling

For error handling, the `Huex.Bridge` struct has a `status` attribute which is either set to `:ok` or `:error` by command functions.

When an error occured, the complete error response is stored in the `error` attribute of the `Huex.Bridge` struct.

### Examples

Look into the `examples` directory for more advanced usage examples.

## Current Limitations

Color space conversion from RGB to XY currently feels a little fishy: I can't seem to get bright green or red using the given formula.

## To Do

- [ ] Reliable color conversion from RGB
